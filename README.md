# Work-Day-Scheduler
Work Day Scheduler using Third-Party APIs

I've created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The app:

* Displays the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
 
* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
 
* Color-codes each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
 
* Allows a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page
